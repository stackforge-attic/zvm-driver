"""A connection to an IBM z/VM Virtualization system.

Generally, OpenStack z/VM virt driver will call xCat REST API to operate
to z/VM hypervisors.xCat has a control point(a virtual machine) in z/VM
system, which enables xCat management node to control the z/VM system.
OpenStack z/VM driver will communicate with xCat management node through
xCat REST API. Thus OpenStack can operate to z/VM system indirectly.
